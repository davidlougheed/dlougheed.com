					Genotyping short tandem repeats using long reads

				<p>
					Short tandem repeats (STRs) are repetitive regions, composed of a small "motif"
					(e.g., <code>CAG</code>) repeated several times in a row (<code>CAGCAGCAGCAG&hellip;</code>)
					which make up about 5% of the human genome and are implicated in gene expression and disease in
					humans. Due to their repetitiveness, they can be difficult to genotype with traditional short-read
					sequencing. As part of my Master's project in
					<a href="https://computationalgenomics.ca/BourqueLab/" class="subtle-link">
						Prof. Guillaume Bourque</a>'s lab,
					I wrote a tool called <a href="projects.html#strkit" class="subtle-link">STRkit</a> to genotype
					these regions using long-read sequencing data, which at the time of writing achieves
					state-of-the-art performance in key benchmarking metrics.

				<span>Population structure in rockhole frogs <em>(ongoing)</em></span>
				<p>
					The Australian rockhole frog (<em>Litoria meiriana</em>) is a species of very small frog endemic to
					a small portion of northern Australia. Work on this project, primarily occurring at the
					<a href="https://sclougheed.ca" class="subtle-link">Lougheed Lab</a> at Queen's University, is
					examining the fine-grained population genetic structure occurring in this species and testing
					whether hydrology is implicated.

					Detecting parental inheritance of human telomere alleles

				</span>
				<p>
					<a href="https://computationalgenomics.ca/BourqueLab/" class="subtle-link">Bourque Lab</a> PhD
					student Yuxin Zhou's research focuses on telomeric inheritance in humans. Telomeres in humans are
					composed of primarily hexamer repeat units (the canonical repeat unit being <code>TTAGGG</code>).
					Telomere variable regions ("TVRs") contain variant repeat units, which form a "barcode" that can be
					used to trace parent-child telomere inheritance. For this project, I helped construct an algorithm,
					<a href="https://github.com/davidlougheed/teloscore" class="subtle-link">TeloScore</a>, for scoring
					similarities between TVR alleles.

					I helped <a href="https://yingchen94.github.io/" class="subtle-link">Ying Chen</a> (at the time a
					PhD student at Queen's University, now a Bioinformatics Specialist in the
					<a href="https://www.vertebrategenomelab.org/home" class="subtle-link">Vertebrate Genome Lab</a> at
					Rockefeller University) assemble the first reference genome for the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_chorus_frog" class="subtle-link">
						western chorus frog</a> (<em>Pseudacris triseriata</em>). In addition to providing a new
					reference genome for future research, this work uncovered the sex determination system in this frog
					and identified genes that may be important in anuran evolution.
